I cleaned the modelisation notebook, i added the two libraries, and  i will need to clean those libraries before the meeting on friday.
## TODO Clean libraries
The modelisation is already cleaned, so now i can add the part about the modelisation.

I finished the EDA part, and started the modelisation part.
I added the data augmentation and the data generatore, and then added two libraries with the functions needed;
Now i will proceed with the cleaning of the code by creating, first, a new branch on git.

I fixed the EDA part, and i added two masks to limit the categories and then i also find a way to justify this work, also i added a new work process including git so that from now on we will have more control over my code.

I'm trying to extract the labels from the JSON file and show them so that i can justify my choice but it seems a difficult job to do, i might try to find another way of doing this task.

Okay now is making more sense, i want to mask the json of the file so that when it's analyzed it will return only 8 categories wich are defined in the labelId, i have to find a way to justify my choice, for that purpose i have to look in the documentations of the official site.

Now, the problem that i'm encountering is related to the categories, i have to find a way to reduce the categories to 8, insted of 32, then i will be able to go to the modelisation phase, even faster that i predicted.
